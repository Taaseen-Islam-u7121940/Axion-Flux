# Solar axion detection with SABRE-South
Taaseen Islam, Laby Vacation Scholar at UniMelb Winter 2024. Feel free to email me at u7121940@anu.edu.au for any questions (or my personal email taaseen.islam13@gmail.com after I graduate in late 2025).  
## Important/useful papers:
- "Bragg-Primakoff Axion Photoconversion in Crystal Detectors", Dent et.al 2023 http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04861
    - Describes the ultimate equation, process, and exclusion plot to work towards. Note that many of the derivations assume monatomic crystals, so some extra steps are involved with NaI (which I will attempt to describe)
- "On Coherence in Bragg-Primakoff Axion Photoconversion", Thompson 2023 http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01767
    - A PhD thesis with the work discussed in Dent et.al. Has several other useful results.
- "The landscape of QCD axion models", Di Luzio et.al 2020 https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01100v4
    - Describes axions and their representations with various models for a more theoretical description of what's happening
- "Prospects of solar axion searches with crystal detectors" Cebrian et.al 1999 http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811359
    - Older look at using crystals to detect axions with more thorough derivations that do differ from Dent et.al's results (mainly from the definitions of some parameters)
## Code description
This code was developed by me over 4 weeks with the ultimate goal of evaluating SABRE-South's prospects in finding solar axions. 

## Directories
explain them idk lol
